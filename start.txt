Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e., devices whose operating system is typically built into
 the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart
 home devices, video game consoles, televisions (Samsung and LG smart TVs),[36][37][38] automobiles
 (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Toyota),[39]
 and spacecraft (Falcon 9 rocket, Dragon crew capsule, and the Ingenuity Mars helicopter).[40][41]

Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration.
 The source code may be used, modified, and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone 
 under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
 The Linux kernel, for example, is licensed under the GPLv2, with an exception for system calls
 that allows code that calls the kernel via system calls not to be licensed under the GPL.[42][43][25]
